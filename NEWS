Version 0.4-2
- initial support for extracting model modification indices, when available: extractModIndices
- bugfix: Corrected problem with extractModelSummaries failing when analyis or data sections were at the end of the input.
- bugfix: Corrected whitespace stripping for cases where leading and trailing space is present.

Version 0.4-1

- initial support for extracting fit statistics from DATA: TYPE=MONTECARLO output (external Monte Carlo)
- show summary routines now check to make sure that all columns requested are present in the summary data.frame.
- show summary routines now check for the sortBy column for cases where the sort field is missing.
- bugfix: properly handle blank sections in model results output.
- bugfix: getSavedata_Fileinfo now properly handles relative and absolute paths in the savedata location.
- better debug output for extractModelParameters.

Version 0.4

- unified model parsing function readModels() implemented. Returns list of summaries, parameters, and savedata output.
- completely refactored extractModelSummaries. Now handles more summary statistics, including initial support of MI output.
- extractModelSummaries now drops any fields that are all missing.
- preliminary support for extracting model summary statistics from EFA output.
- bugfix: warning for missing LL now falls appropriately after extraction of estimator in extractModelSummaries
- bugfix: grabResultsSection failed when there was more than one match for a section header.
- bugfix: extractModelSummaries now correctly extracts SRMR for multilevel models.
- extractModelSummaries now retains only the filename, not the path, in the Filename field.
- bugfix: getSavedata_Data now properly handles output file located in the working directory.
- changed getSavedata_Data to give a warning, not error, when save data not present in output.
- restrict extractModelSummaries function to TESTS OF MODEL FIT output.
- bugfix: prepareMplusData now correctly converts factors to numbers.
- bugfix: prepareMplusData converts periods in variable names to underscores.
- reorganized source files for improved clarity

Version 0.3-3

- extractModelParameters extracts 6-column output from estimator=bayes models (Mplus V6).
- extractModelParameters supports (most) older output format from Mplus 4.2 and later.
- extractModelParameters function now accepts a single output file or a directory, like extractModelSummaries. Return a list if multiple files.
- extractModelParameters now extracts unstandardized and standardized results, where available. Returns a list. resultType is deprecated.
- extractModelParameters now extracts constraints listed under "New/Additional Parameters".
- bugfix: extractModelParameters omitted latent class regression coefficients in mixture models.
- bugfix: extractModelParameters could not locate section end for some standardized parameters.
- bugfix: extractModelParameters failed to identify latent class membership with multiple categorical latent variables. 
- Changed runModels to limit Windows-specific command line tweaks to R running on Windows computers.
- Removed InputInstructions from extractModelSummaries routine. Made output too cluttered.
- In extractModelSummaries routine, only warn about missing log-likelihood for ML estimators.
- Changed runModels_Interactive to use native TCL directory browser on non-Windows machines.
- Improved runModels_Interactive to place log file in same directory as run target, unless otherwise selected.
- Changed Mplus call in runModels to use relative filename after changing to the proper directory (improves Linux runs).
- bugfix: corrected runModels attempt to write log file when NULL specified.
- plyr 1.0 hid (and changed) the splitter_a function, which made createModels fail. Replaced splitter_a with homespun function.

Version 0.3-2

- Added prepareMplusData convenience function, used to export data from R to Mplus.
- Fixed bug in updateCurrentValues that would stop the createModels pipeline when there were no array tags in the init.
- Fixed bug in processConditionalTags that would delete the body section when there were no matching tags.

Version 0.3-1

- Removed two browser calls from processInit that were causing pauses in createModels.
- Reduced console output from createModels (no more "current iterator is" output)
- Refactored extractModelParameters to handle complex outputs (e.g., multiple groups with twolevel)
- Refactored extractModelParameters to read standardized estimates from WLS and MUML estimators.

Version 0.3

- Corrected bug with getSaveData_Fileinfo not reading integer-format variables (e.g., I5).
- Includes first implementation of Mplus template language: createModels function.
- Improved handling of runModels log file. Was closing the file before exitRun had completed.
- Fixed bug in isLogOpen that caused it to error when logFile was NULL.
- Improved parameter checking in splitFilePath
- Removed createTable function (now divided into LatexSummaryTable, HTMLSummaryTable, and showSummaryTable functions)
- Updated Vignette for Mplus template language.

Version 0.2-5

- Extracts Baseline Chi-square, SRMR, and WRMR using extractModelSummaries.
- Allows target for extractModelSummaries to be a single file or a directory.
- extractModelParameters now successfully extracts multiple group analyses. 
- Fixed minor bug in extractModelParameters for calculating keyword match length.
- Fixed minor bug in regular expression for parseChunk matching leading/trailing spaces (handled by strip.white).

Version 0.2-4

- Added package vignette (in the inst/doc directory).
- Included NEWS file.
- Added flush commands to log file writing in runModels to allow for progress tracking.

Version 0.2-3

- Separated table-creating functions (previously createTable) into three related routines:
  showSummaryTable, HTMLSummaryTable, and LatexSummaryTable. createTable will be removed in future
  versions of the package.

Version 0.2-2

- Improved extractModelSummaries function to allow for summary statistics located across multiple lines.
  New summaries include model chi-square, RMSEA, CFI, and TLI.
  
- Corrected a bug in extractValue that did not select the correctly utilize match.length from regexpr
  (failure to subtract 1 in substr).
