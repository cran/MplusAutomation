- Allows target for extractModelSummaries to be a single file or a directory.
- extractModelParameters now successfully extracts multiple group analyses. 
- Fixed minor bug in extractModelParameters for calculating keyword match length.
- Fixed minor bug in regular expression for parseChunk matching leading/trailing spaces (handled by strip.white).
